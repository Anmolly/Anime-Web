          Vegito is a mixture of both Goku and Vegeta's characteristics, with a few deviations.
          He has the same body type as Goku, while his hair color is dark brown
          to reddish brown. He has Goku's softer jawline and Vegeta's sharper eyes.
          Vegito's upper hair style stands firmly upwards like Vegeta, while having
          Goku's hairline and has two bangs sticking out like a downward "V" shape.
          When he transforms into a Super Saiyan or Super Saiyan Blue, his hair
          shape stays the same. Vegito wears two yellow Potara earrings as result
          of the Potara fusion, and wears Goku's style of clothing with the colors
          reversed, reflecting Vegeta's outfit; he wears a blue gi and sash with
          an orange undershirt. Also from Vegeta, he wears white gloves and boots.
